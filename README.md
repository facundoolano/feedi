# feedi

feedi is a web feed reader with a minimal interface akin to a Mastodon or Twitter feed.

![](feedi.png)

Features:
- Easy local and self-hosted environment setup.
- Mastodon home and notification streams support.
- Hackable RSS parsers and ad hoc scrapers.
- Smart feed sorting options (highlight infrequent sources, auto mark as read).
- Local article reading and preview using Mozilla's reader mode.
- Send to Kindle device support.

See the documentation below and the [devlog](DEVLOG.md) for notes about its design and implementation.

## Installation
feedi requires Python >= 3.9. If you don't have it installed already consider using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

To install feedi on a local environment:

    git clone https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi.git
    cd feedi
    make

Then, to run the app:

    make run

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.

Alternatively, you can build and run the app in a docker container with `make docker`. Read below for [non-local setup instructions](#non-local-setup).

## Basic usage
### Adding sources
By default, your feed will be empty. You can load some content from a set of [default websites](feeds.csv) if you want to get a quick feel of how the app works:

    make feed-load feed-sync

Otherwise, you can manually add sources by clicking the `+ Add Feed` button or navigating to `http://localhost:5000/feeds/new`. When you first add a feed, the app  will fetch its most recent articles, then it will check periodically for new content (every 30 minutes [by default](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/15add28488c5800eef2dbcb43adf1355da9133c3/feedi/config/default.py#L5)) .

You can also import a collection of feeds from an [OPML or CSV file]((#bulk-importexport-feeds-from-csv-and-opml-files)).

### Browsing the feed
The interface is arranged as a social-media like scrollable stream of articles (minus the tracking, ads and feed "curation"). Each source feed can optionally be put into a folder, which then constitutes its own filtered stream. Some of the behavior of those streams can be controlled via settings on the right-side of the screen (desktop) or on the navbar manu (mobile).

Although strict chronological sorting of the entries is available, it has the issue that, if you mix news articles and social media streams with slower-paced sources as magazines and blogs, the least frequent (and often more interesting) articles will tend to get buried in the stream and go unnoticed. Because of this, the default feed sorting will feature the least-frequent sources more prominently. There's also a third, more experimental, sorting criteria: showing entries from "most liked" feeds, based on how frequently those have been read.

Since these alternative sorting criteria break the chronological order of entries, it means that some older, better scored entries will precede newer ones. To prevent the same content being displayed every time you open the feed, the app will track "already viewed" entries as you scroll and hide them next time you load it.
This is considered preferrable to having to manually mark entries as read,
not just because it's less work but because the app is [not arranged](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river) around the idea of [clearing an inbox](https://danq.me/2023/07/29/rss-zero/). You can, of course, pin entries to the top of the feed or mark them as favorites to go back to them later. You can also just disable the hiding of already seen entries.

Another peculiarity of the feed metaphor is that some entries are more content-centric articles (eg. blog posts) and some more user-centric updates (eg. Mastodon toots). The entry parsers are implemented to choose between user or content display depending on what info is available from the source.

### Reading articles
There are different ways to interact with a feed entry:

- If you click on the article title the original website will be open on a new browser tab.
- In some cases, as with link agreggators like reddit, hacker news or lobste.rs, there will be a separate link for the article discussion.
- If you click on the content or press Enter when focusing on the entry, the article content will be fetch and displayed on the local reader. This will be a stripped-down version of the article (removing some site links, ads and paywalls) powered by the [mozilla/readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library. Note that for this to work you need node >= 20 installed when setting up the project.
  -  The reader can also be used to preview arbitrary articles by dragging their url to the searchbox.


## Advanced features
### Bulk import/export feeds from csv and OPML files

`make feed-load` will load feeds from a local `feeds.csv` file. A [sample file](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/HEAD/feeds.csv) is included in the repo
in case you want to see some content right away.

There's also a `make feed-load-opml` to import a list of RSS feeds from a `feeds.opml` file in the [OPML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML).

There are analogous `make feed-dump` and `make feed-dump-opml` targets to export feed data from the app.

### Mastodon account setup

One or more Mastodon accounts can be added to ingest the user home feed and notifications.
The account login flow isn't supported in the web interface yet, so some steps need to be run manually
in the python shell to obtain a user access token:

    make shell
    >>> import mastodon
    >>> Mastodon.create_app("feedi", scopes=['read'], to_file='mastodon.creds', api_base_url='https://mastodon.social')

The code above will register a `feedi` app in the mastodon.social server, storing the client and secret in the `mastodon.creds` file.
Note that you don't need to create more than one app per server (even if to plan to log in mutliple times or multiple accounts,
the same app credentials file can be reused).

Once app credentials are available, they can be used to instantiate a client and log in a user to obtain an access token:

    >>> client = Mastodon('mastodon.creds', api_base_url='https://mastodon.social')
    >>> client.log_in(username='some@email.address', password='password', scopes=['read'])
    [CLIENT ACCESS TOKEN PRINTED HERE]

With the resulting access token, you can add the user home feed or the user notification feed from the web UI by accessing
 `/feeds/new` and selecting feed type `Mastodon` or `Mastodon Notifications`. (the same access token can be reused to add
 both feeds).

See the [Mastodon.py documentation](https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#usage) for further details.

### Github notification feed
You can ingest the notifications from GitHub into feedi. To do so, navigate to your home feed at https://github.com/, open the page HTML source and search for an atom feed link. It should look something like:

``` html
  <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" title="ATOM" href="/facundoolano.private.atom?token=<TOKEN>" />
```

Copy the href url and use it to add a new RSS feed in feedi.

### Goodreads home feed
You can ingest the notifications from Goodreads.com into feedi. To do so, navigate to your home feed at https://www.goodreads.com/, open the page HTML source and search for an atom feed link. It should look something like:

``` html
<link href='https://www.goodreads.com/home/index_rss/<ID>?key=<KEY>' rel='alternate' title='Goodreads' type='application/atom+xml'>
```

Copy the href url and use it to add a new RSS feed in feedi.

### Kindle device support (experimental)

The app allows to register a kindle device to send the cleaned up article HTML to it, yielding better results
than the default Amazon Send to Kindle Chrome extension.

To enable the "send to kindle" feature on your user, navigate to `/auth/kindle` and follow the instructions to register the device credentials.

This features uses the [stkclient](https://github.com/maxdjohnson/stkclient) library and stores device credentials in the DB file (use at your own risk).

### Feed parsing

The app works by [periodically](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/bf2df4c313e7e719a16d3c2f8216452031a38e58/feedi/config/default.py#L12) fetching
items from different feed sources (RSS/Atom, Mastodon toots and notifications, custom scrapers) and adjusting them to an
[Entry db model](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/bf2df4c313e7e719a16d3c2f8216452031a38e58/feedi/models.py#L107) which more or less matches what we expect to display in the front end.

#### RSS/Atom feeds

Most RSS feeds should be processed correctly by the default parser, but sometimes it's desirable to add customizations that cleanup or extend the data for a better look and feel. This can be done by subclassing [feedi.parsers.rss.BaseParser](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/4e6b7974b70c70abb4a0f7091adbe344ef0b29a1/feedi/parsers/rss.py#L40). The `is_compatible` static method determines whether a given feed should be parsed with that specific class; the `parse_*` methods overrides the default logic for each field expected in the front end.

As an example, this parser for the lobste.rs link aggregator is adjusted to inline a summary of external link submissions and distinguish between the source article url and the lobste.rs discussion url:

``` python
class LobstersParser(BaseParser):
    def is_compatible(_feed_url, feed_data):
        return 'lobste.rs' in feed_data['feed'].get('link', '')

    def parse_body(self, entry):
        # A 'Comments' link is only present on external link submissions
        if 'Comments' in entry['summary']:
            url = self.parse_content_url(entry)
            return (self.fetch_meta(url, 'og:description') or
                    self.fetch_meta(url, 'description'))
        return entry['summary']

    def parse_entry_url(self, entry):
        # return the discussion url, which is different from entry['link']
        # for external links
        if 'Comments' in entry['summary']:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(entry['summary'], 'lxml')
            return soup.find("a", string="Comments")['href']
        return entry['link']
```

You can see several custom RSS parsers in [this module](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/main/feedi/parsers/rss.py).

#### Custom feeds

Other than RSS and Mastodon feeds, the app can ingest arbitrary sources with custom parsers. This is useful for scraping websites that don't provide feeds or consuming JSON APIs directly.

To add a custom parser, subclass [feedi.parsers.custom.CustomParser](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/4e6b7974b70c70abb4a0f7091adbe344ef0b29a1/feedi/parsers/custom.py#L20). The `is_compatible` method determines wheter a given url should be parsed with that parser. The `fetch` method does the actual fetching and parsing of entries. See the [feedi.parsers.custom](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/HEAD/feedi/parsers/custom.py) module for some examples.

Once the parser is implemented, it will be used when a new feed of type "Custom" is added in the webapp with the expected url.

### User management

The default app configuration assumes a single-user unauthenticated setup, but authentication can be enabled in case security is necessary,
for example to deploy the app on the internet or to support multiple accounts.

To enable user authentication:

1. Remove the `DEFAULT_AUTH_USER` setting from the [configuration](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/HEAD/feedi/config/default.py).
2. If you already have a DB created, reset it with `make db-reset`. Or, alternatively, remove the default user
with `make user-del EMAIL=admin@admin.com`. Note that this will also remove feeds and entries associated to it in the DB.
3. You can create new users by running `make user-add EMAIL=some@email.address`. The command will prompt for a password.

Note that there's no open user registration functionality exposed to the front end, but it should be straightforward to add it if you need it. Check the [auth module](https://github.com/facundoolano/feedi/blob/HEAD/feedi/auth.py) and the [flask-login documentation](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details.

### Non-local setup
You can refer to the [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/deploying/) for a instructions on how to deploy feedi to a non-local environment. The [setup script](./setup_server.sh) included in the repository shows an example setup for a Debian server. You can run it remotely with ssh like `make prod-install SSH=user@server`.
