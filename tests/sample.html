<p><strong>As a user</strong>, I had some ideas of what I wanted from this project.</p>

<p><strong>As a developer</strong>, I wanted to test some of the ideas I’d been ruminating on for over a year. Although I hadn’t yet formulated it in those terms, I wanted to apply what I expressed in <a href="../2023-11-30-code-is-run-more-than-read">another post</a> as: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code>. This meant that, when prioritizing tasks or making design trade-offs, I would choose ease of operation over development convenience, and I would put user experience above everything else.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>Given that mental framework, I needed to make some initial technical decisions.</p>
